Interfaces : Interface in C# is a blueprint of a class. It is like abstract class because all the methods which are declared inside the interface are abstract methods.
Benefits of using interfaces:

1. Interfaces allow us to implement polymorphic behaviour. 

2. Interfaces allow us to develop very loosely coupled systems.
3. Interfaces enable mocking for better unit testing.

4. Interfaces enables us to implement multiple class inheritance in C#.

5. Interfaces are great for implementing Inverson of Control or Dependancy Injection.

6. Interfaces enable parallel application development.
